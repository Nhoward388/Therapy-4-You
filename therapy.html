        <h5>What is Therapy For You?</h5>
        <p>Therapy For You (T4U) is an online therapy site that provides an affordable but equally effective method of treating mental illness and depression. We strive to provide quality help for those in need and want to help make this world a happier and better place to live.</p><br>
        <h5>Is online therapy really effective?</h5>
        <p>Online therapy has been around for more than twenty years and has been utilized mostly by former military soldiers. Still fairly new in industry standards online therapy studies that have been conducted by the American Psychological Association have come out with good reviews showing that online therapy can be just as effective as in-person therapy. </p><br>
        <h5>What is the price range of Therapy For You? How much more affordable is online therapy in comparison to in-person therapy?</h5>
        <p>The price range is split up in three main categories. Our highest price category is the level three executive category followed by the level two premium/bonus category and the level one startup category. All levels, however, provide therapy of the same quality. As seen in the chart, in person-therapy can cost $75-$100 per session per hour compared to online therapy’s monthly payment plan.*For more information see the chart below</p><br>
        <h5>Are there cases in which online therapy should not be used?</h5>
        <p>If one has extremely chronic depression and mental health issues it is recommended that he/she checks in in person at a clinic or hospital for evaluation. Online-therapy may not be enough, in that case, by itself.</p><br>
        <h5>Why was Therapy For You started? What was the inspiration?</h5>
        <p>Therapy for you started because of a project where we had to come up with a company that would make the world a better place. We all unanimously agreed that we wanted to help reach a world where less people are depressed and more people are happy, hence our slogan heartache to happy.</p><br>
        <h5>Is there a fixed monthly plan for T4U?</h5>
        <p>*See the chart below for monthly plans</p><br>
        <h5>How can I provide my services if I am a therapist?</h5>
        <p>Call our number or email to set up an interview. Our human resources director will gladly be at your disposal for any further questions.</p><br>
        <h5>How do I know I should sign up for Therapy?</h5>
        <p>There is a series of question in the therapy section that will allow our employees and health specialists to evaluate and determine needs. If you complete the questions it should give you immediate feedback on your status. Also, if you have been diagnosed by a doctor for any mental health issues this may be the right place for you.</p><br>
